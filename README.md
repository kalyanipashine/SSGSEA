SSGSEA
Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA), an extension of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), 
calculates separate enrichment scores for each pairing of a sample and gene set.
Each ssGSEA enrichment score represents the degree to which the genes in a particular gene 
set are coordinately up- or down-regulated within a sample.
